# KnowStuff
This **KnowLedger** repository is for collecting resources and tools you use in your research - you know the **stuff** 
that you could not do without.  In order or make KnowLedger a research enabling system, we need to understand and 
integrate all the cool things that you use in your research.  But this project is so broad in scope we need you tell 
us what you use so we can catalog it here and work toward common approaches to supporting as many as possible.

Starting out we can think of the following different categories of resources/tools:
- [API tool or service]()
- [best practices for research data management](resources/bestpractices.md)
- [command line tools used in research](resources/cltools.md)
- [databases with domain specific or general metadata and/or data](resources/databases.md)
- [file formats and format convertes for research data](resources/fileformats.md)
- [general or specialized domain repositories](resources/datarepos.md)
- [metadata/data schema/frameworks for research data](resources/dataschema.md)
- [research data visualization and data analysis tools](resources/viztools.md)
- [vocabularies, terminologies, taxonomies, or ontologies](resources/vocabs.md)

If you have a resource that fits in the above categories please fill out a GitHub issue using the appropriate issue
template.  If it does not fit these categories add it to the generic issue template, and we will sort it out!

Thanks in advance for helping!
